# cupper README

Cupper is a small extension for all COBOL users of VS Code who like to use capital letters in their code.

## Features

A new command, called "Convert COBOL Keywords to upper case" is available after installing/enabling the extension. It converts in any document all strings to upper case but ignores comment lines and literal assignments (e.g. MOVE "interest rate" to WS-VAR)
